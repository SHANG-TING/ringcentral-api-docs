# Developer tools for RingCentral Add-ins 

To help developers build their add-in applications, these tools and examples are available for use and modification. The tools make it easier to build your own integration on the add-in platform and the examples show how we built the add-ins available publicly for our RingCentral App customers.

## Developer Tools

* [Notification App Developer Tool](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-notification-app-developer-tool) - This tool enables developers to build their initial installation as well as setup/configuration page once the app is installed.

* [Add-in Framework Tool](https://github.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-add-in-framework-js) - This helper tool provides a template for building notification add-ins using JavaScript.  Examples in the tool show how different OAuth methods can be built into the add-in.
