# Create Team Messaging Team Quick Start

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you create a new RingCentral team in just a few minutes. Let's get started.

## Create App and Get Credentials

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create Team App" button below. Just click the button, enter a name and description if you choose, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "REST API App" under "What type of app are you creating?" Click "Next."</li>
<li>Under "Authentication" select "Password-based auth flow."
<li>Under "Security" add the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>Glip</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Under "Security" select "This app is private and will only be callable using credentials from the same RingCentral account."</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Download and edit a `.env` file
	
Follow the instructions found in our guide to [running Developer Guide code samples](../../basics/code-samples/). Or:
	
1. Download our [env-template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-api-docs/main/code-samples/env-template) and save it as a file named `.env`.
2. Edit your newly downloaded `.env` file, setting its variables with the proper values for the app you created above.
