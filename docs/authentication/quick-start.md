# Authorization Flow Authentication

Welcome to the RingCentral Platform. RingCentral is the leading unified communications platform. From one system developers can integrate with, or build products around all the ways people communicate today: SMS, voice, fax, chat and meetings.

In this Quick Start, we are going to help you authorize a user to login with username and password to get an access token and a refresh token. Let's get started.

## Create an App

The first thing we need to do is create an app in the RingCentral Developer Portal. This can be done quickly by clicking the "Create User Login App" button below. Enter a name and description if you want to change them, and click the "Create" button. If you do not yet have a RingCentral account, you will be prompted to create one.

<a target="_new" href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/new-app?name=Authorization+Flow+Quick+Start+App&desc=A+simple+app+to+demo+authorizing+user+on+RingCentral&public=false&type=ServerWeb&carriers=7710,7310,3420&permissions=ReadAccounts,ReadCallLog&redirectUri=http://localhost:5000/oauth2callback&utm_source=devguide&utm_medium=button&utm_campaign=quickstart" class="btn btn-primary">Create User Login App</a>
<a class="btn-link btn-collapse" data-toggle="collapse" href="#create-app-instructions" role="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="create-app-instructions">Show detailed instructions</a>

<div class="collapse" id="create-app-instructions">
<ol>
<li><a href="https://developer.ringcentral.com/login.html#/">Login or create an account</a> if you have not done so already.</li>
<li>Go to Console/Apps and click 'Create App' button.</li>
<li>Select "REST API App" under "What type of app are you creating?" Click "Next."</li>
<li>Under "Authentication" select "3-legged OAuth flow authorization code" and then "Server-side web app."</li>
<li>Under "Authentication" specify the redirect Uri as http://localhost:5000/oauth2callback.</li>
<li>Under "Security" add the following permissions:
  <ul>
    <li>ReadAccounts</li>
    <li>ReadCallLog</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Under "Security" select "This app is private and will only be callable using credentials from the same RingCentral account."</li>
</ol>
</div>

When you are done, you will be taken to the app's dashboard. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret. We will be using those momentarily.

## Download and edit a `.env` file
	
Follow the instructions found in our guide to [running Developer Guide code samples](../../basics/code-samples/). Or:
	
1. Download our [env-template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ringcentral/ringcentral-api-docs/main/code-samples/env-template) and save it as a file named `.env`.
2. Edit your newly downloaded `.env` file, setting its variables with the proper values for the app you created above.

## Graduate Your App

Congratulations on creating your first RingCentral application. The last step is to graduate your application. We recommend [going through this process](../../basics/production) for your first application so you can understand the steps to take in the future, but also to come to appreciate the care taken by RingCentral to ensure that only high-quality apps are allowed into our production environment.
